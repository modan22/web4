        <h2>When Do You Need a Landing Page?
        </h2>
        <p>There are instances where a landing page is the most effective choice to drive sales or capture leads. It might be when you use PPC advertising, a lead magnet, focus attention, to attract different types of customers or for easier testing.</p>

        <h2>Lead Generation Landing Page
        </h2>
        <p>A lead-generation or lead-capture landing page is primarily intended to collect leads by means of a data-capture form. These pages are very versatile but are most often used in the middle of the sales funnel, at the point where customers are evaluating your offerings and are on the cusp of moving towards the intent to either convert or walk away. It presents both a request and a reward simultaneously. The reward is the specific offer you are promoting in order to capture leads, and the request is the information you ask for in your form. The request and the reward should be well-balanced. Whatever you are promoting must be worth the customer offering you their details and adding them to your mailing list.</p>

        <h2>Squeeze Page
        </h2>
        <p>Like a lead-generation page, a squeeze page is used to collect data. Unlike a lead-generation page, however, it is generally employed near the top of the sales funnel, and its only goal is to gather email addresses to add potential leads to a general mailing list. They are short, basic landing pages with bold headlines and minimal content. A clear call to action leaves the reader in no doubt as to what to expect from the click-through. In addition to the short form, there should also be both a link to take the reader to the next step and an exit option if the visitor does not wish to proceed.</p>
